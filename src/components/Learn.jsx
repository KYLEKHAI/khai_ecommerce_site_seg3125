                  Unlike the rubber dome keyboards that come with most
                  computers, mechanical keyboards use individual switches for
                  each key. This means every keypress is registered by a
                  physical switch mechanism, providing better tactile feedback,
                  durability, and customization options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty of mechanical keyboards lies in their versatility.
                  Whether you're a gamer looking for speed, a programmer seeking
                  precision, or someone who simply enjoys the satisfying feel of
                  a well-crafted keyboard, there's a mechanical option perfect
                  for you.

              Understanding Switches: The Heart of Your Keyboard
            </h2>
            <div className="section-content">
              <div className="blog-post">
                <h3>What Are Switches and Why Do They Matter?</h3>
                <p>
                  Switches are the individual mechanisms under each key that
                  register your keystrokes. Think of them as tiny buttons that
                  tell your computer when you've pressed a key. The type of
                  switch you choose dramatically affects how your keyboard feels
                  and sounds.
                </p>

                <h3>Linear Switches: Smooth and Silent</h3>
                <p>
                  Linear switches provide a smooth, consistent keystroke from
                  top to bottom without any tactile feedback or audible click.
                  They're like pressing a button that goes straight down - no
                  bumps, no clicks, just smooth motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Best for:</strong> Gamers who need fast, consistent
                  keypresses without distractions. The lack of tactile feedback
                  means you can press keys quickly without waiting for a "bump"
                  to know the key has been registered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular options:</strong> Red switches (light and
                  fast), Black switches (heavier resistance), Yellow switches
                  (balanced feel)
                </p>

                <h3>Tactile Switches: Feel the Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                  Tactile switches provide a noticeable bump when the key
                  actuates, giving you physical feedback that the key has been
                  pressed. It's like pressing a button that has a small "hump"
                  in the middle of its travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Best for:</strong> Typists who want to know exactly
                  when their keypress has been registered. The tactile bump
                  helps prevent accidental double-presses and provides
                  satisfying feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular options:</strong> Brown switches (gentle
                  bump), Clear switches (stronger bump), Purple switches
                  (balanced tactile feel)
                </p>

                <h3>Clicky Switches: Audible Satisfaction</h3>
                <p>
                  Clicky switches combine tactile feedback with an audible click
                  sound. They provide the most feedback of any switch type,
                  making them incredibly satisfying to use - though they can be
                  quite loud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Best for:</strong> Users who love the classic
                  mechanical keyboard sound and want maximum feedback. Perfect
                  for home offices where noise isn't a concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular options:</strong> Blue switches (classic
                  clicky feel), Green switches (heavier clicky), White switches
                  (quieter clicky option)
                </p>

              Keyboard Layouts: Finding Your Perfect Size
            </h2>
            <div className="section-content">
              <div className="blog-post">
                <h3>Why Layout Matters</h3>
                <p>
                  Keyboard layouts aren't just about size - they're about how
                  you work. Different layouts offer different trade-offs between
                  functionality, desk space, and portability. Understanding
                  these differences helps you choose the right keyboard for your
                  needs.
                </p>

                <h3>Full-Size (100%): The Complete Experience</h3>
                <p>
                  Full-size keyboards include everything: the main typing area,
                  function keys, navigation cluster, and a full number pad. This
                  is what most people think of when they imagine a keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Perfect for:</strong> Office work, data entry,
                  accounting, and anyone who regularly uses the number pad. If
                  you need all the keys and have the desk space, this is your
                  best option.
                </p>

                <h3>Tenkeyless (TKL - 87%): Compact but Complete</h3>
                <p>
                  TKL keyboards remove the number pad while keeping everything
                  else. This saves significant desk space while maintaining most
                  functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Perfect for:</strong> Gamers who want more mouse
                  space, programmers who rarely use the number pad, and anyone
                  who wants a more compact setup without sacrificing function
                  keys.
                </p>

                <h3>75% Layout: Smart Space Saving</h3>
                <p>
                  75% keyboards condense the function keys and navigation into a
                  more compact format. They're smaller than TKL but still
                  include most functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Perfect for:</strong> Users who want a smaller
                  footprint but still need function keys and navigation. Great
                  for productivity work in limited spaces.
                </p>

                <h3>60% Layout: Minimalist Approach</h3>
                <p>
                  60% keyboards contain only the main typing area. Function
                  keys, navigation, and number pad are accessed through key
                  combinations or layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Perfect for:</strong> Minimalists, travelers, and
                  users who prefer a clean, uncluttered desk. Requires learning
                  key combinations but offers maximum portability.

            <h2 className="section-title">The Art of Keyboard Modding</h2>
            <div className="section-content">
              <div className="blog-post">
                <h3>What is Keyboard Modding?</h3>
                <p>
                  Keyboard modding is the practice of customizing and improving
                  your keyboard beyond its factory settings. It's like tuning a
                  car - you start with a good base and make it even better to
                  suit your preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modding can improve sound, feel, aesthetics, and performance.
                  It's a way to make your keyboard truly yours, tailored to your
                  specific needs and preferences.
                </p>

                <h3>Lubing: The Foundation of Smooth Switches</h3>
                <p>
                  Lubricating your switches is one of the most impactful mods
                  you can do. Factory switches often feel scratchy or
                  inconsistent, but proper lubing can make them feel buttery
                  smooth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>What it does:</strong> Reduces friction between moving
                  parts, eliminates scratchiness, and creates a more consistent
                  feel across all keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular lubes:</strong> Krytox 205g0 for smooth feel,
                  Krytox 105 for springs, dielectric grease for stabilizers
                </p>

                <h3>Stabilizer Modding: Fixing the Big Keys</h3>
                <p>
                  Stabilizers are the mechanisms that support larger keys like
                  spacebar, shift, and enter. Stock stabilizers often rattle and
                  feel inconsistent compared to the main switches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Common mods:</strong> Clipping stabilizer legs, lubing
                  the stabilizer wire, band-aid modding the PCB, and using
                  dielectric grease to eliminate rattle.
                </p>

                <h3>Case Modding: Sound and Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>
                  The keyboard case affects both sound and appearance. Simple
                  mods like adding foam can dramatically improve sound quality,
                  while more complex modifications can completely change the
                  look and feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular mods:</strong> Adding foam padding for sound
                  dampening, replacing case materials, adding weight for
                  stability, and custom paint jobs for personalization.
                </p>

                <h3>Keycap Considerations: The Final Touch</h3>
                <p>
                  Keycaps are what you touch every time you use your keyboard,
                  so they significantly impact both feel and appearance.
                  Different materials and profiles offer unique experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Materials:</strong> PBT (durable, textured) vs ABS
                  (smooth, can shine over time)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Profiles:</strong> Cherry (low profile), OEM
                  (standard), SA (high profile), DSA (uniform height)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Start with simple
                  mods like lubing switches or adding foam, and gradually work
                  your way up to more complex modifications. The journey is just
                  as rewarding as the destination.
